# teaching

I'm working on building out a bit more of an explanation here ... Essentially, I teach the following courses at IUI:

- Intro to Data Science Programming
- Mathematics for Data Science
- Statistics with R
- Data Visualization Design, Evaluation, and Analysis

Maybe I'll share my CV here once I get my act together.
