# grid navigation

For sample, midi, and tape functionalities, there are four grid pages:

- sequence
- levels
- time
- config

The sample and midi functionalities share the *same* grid pages, so this equates to eight total grid pages. For the most part, these pages are the same for all functionalities, with small deviations for each. In general, all grid pages will share the same navigation bar on the lower right.

Here, **S** corresponds to **sample** and **T** corresponds to **tape**. For each of these, you have the following:

- **_1:** toggle between **sequence** and **levels**.
- **_2:** the **time** page
- **_3:** the **config** page

The **mode** corresponds to the following:

- **PLAY MODE** (bright)
- **FOCUS MODE** (not bright)

Both the **mode** and **ALT** pads correspond to different functions within sample, midi, or tape.
