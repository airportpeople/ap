# sample functionality

Probably, the best way to get to understand the sample functionality is to start with the config page, and work your way backward ... When playing, it's easier to think the other way around.

## grid

### sequence page

{{< figure src="/grid/sample_seq.png" >}}

Each track ...

### config page

For samples, the configuration page manages banks, track parameter settings, and sample playback settings.

#### banks

{{< figure src="/grid/sample_config_1.png" >}}

There are **four banks**.
